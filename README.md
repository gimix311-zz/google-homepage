# google-homepage

This is my take on recreating Google's homepage as part of HTML/CSS project work from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Vendor specific prefixes need to DIE *ugh!!*

I still need to brush up on the Flex box model and the Grid model. Good luck with your own attempt. This has been fun!
