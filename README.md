# google-homepage

This is my take on recreating Google's homepage as part of HTML/CSS project work from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

- Vendor specific prefixes need to DIE **ugh!!**
- Google's using CSS sprites on a PNG image. Nifty.
- If only there were a way to merge multiple SVG files into one and reference each one like you would with sprites. Apparently with SVG this is possible, but has massive memory overhead.
- There is a Mic input icon that shows up in Google Chrome. I didn't bother implementing it.

So much to catch up on. So little time.

I still need to brush up on the Flex box model and the Grid model. Good luck with your own attempt. This has been fun!
